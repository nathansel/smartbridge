I am a big dreamer
I am little bit nervous while speaking in group of people
The only dream job I’ve always had was a job that keeps me busy, a job wherein I get to contribute to the company’s success.
I do understand that it will occasionally be necessary in software industry to work overtime
My hobbies listening to music, sports and coin collection Sir
As I am fresher, Salary is not an issue for me
As long as job challenges me to stretch my skills for professional growth and gives satisfaction that my presence contribution is baneficial for the organization.
